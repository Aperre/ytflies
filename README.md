# YTFlies

#### Youtube compatible steganography tool to upload files

Encodes files to mp4 that can be uploaded to any media hosting service to store your file.
This isn't meant to be a real tool, more just for me to learn C++. Sorry for the bad code in advance.

### Usage:

```
ytflies <encode|decode> <inputfile> [outputfile]
```
